    "### 1. Creating columns\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you'll learn how to use the methods defined by Spark's DataFrame class to perform common data operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at performing column-wise operations. In Spark you can do this using the .withColumn() method, which takes two arguments. First, a string with the name of your new column, and second the new column itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new column must be an object of class Column. Creating one of these is as easy as extracting a column from your DataFrame using df.colName.\n",
    "\n",
    "Updating a Spark DataFrame is somewhat different than working in pandas because the Spark DataFrame is immutable. This means that it can't be changed, and so columns can't be updated in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, all these methods return a new DataFrame. To overwrite the original DataFrame you must reassign the returned DataFrame using the method like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "**df = df.withColumn(\"newCol\", df.oldCol + 1)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The above code creates a DataFrame with the same columns as df plus a new column, newCol, where every entry is equal to the corresponding entry from oldCol, plus one.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overwrite an existing column, just pass the name of the column as the first argument!\n",

    "### 2. Filtering data\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have a bit of SQL know-how under your belt, it's easier to talk about the analogous operations using Spark DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at the .filter() method. As you might suspect, this is the Spark counterpart of SQL's WHERE clause. The .filter() method takes either an expression that would follow the WHERE clause of a SQL expression as a string, or a Spark Column of boolean (True/False) values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following two expressions will produce the same output:\n",
    "\n",
    "***flights.filter(\"air_time > 120\").show()***\n",
    "\n",
    "***flights.filter(flights.air_time > 120).show()***\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that in the first case, we pass a string to .filter(). In SQL, we would write this filtering task as SELECT * FROM flights WHERE air_time > 120. Spark's .filter() can accept any expression that could go in the WHEREclause of a SQL query (in this case, \"air_time > 120\"), as long as it is passed as a string. Notice that in this case, we do not reference the name of the table in the string -- as we wouldn't in the SQL request.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second case, we actually pass a column of boolean values to .filter(). Remember that flights.air_time > 120 returns a column of boolean values that has True in place of those records in flights.air_time that are over 120, and False otherwise.\n",
    "\n",

    "### 3. Selecting\n",
    "\n",
    "The Spark variant of SQL's SELECT is the .select() method. This method takes multiple arguments - one for each column you want to select. These arguments can either be the column name as a string (one for each column) or a column object (using the df.colName syntax). When you pass a column object, you can perform operations like addition or subtraction on the column to change the data contained in it, much like inside .withColumn().\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between .select() and .withColumn() methods is that .select() returns only the columns you specify, while .withColumn() returns all the columns of the DataFrame in addition to the one you defined. It's often a good idea to drop columns you don't need at the beginning of an operation so that you're not dragging around extra data as you're wrangling. In this case, you would use .select() and not .withColumn().\n",
